# JAVA-Payslip-Generator
- This project is a JAVA Console App
- It is programmed using core JAVA, using Object-Oriented Programming(OOP)
- OOP helps to keep the JAVA code DRY `Don't Repeat Yourself`, and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug

## Motivation
The true inspiration behind this project is the manual process of payslip generation in any start-up or small business

student population of approximately 5000 and a large competent workforce.
ABCC staff is divided into 2 major groups, i.e, `Faculty` and `Non-faculty` staff.
- This console app is created for Accounts clerks of this fictional college to generate MULTIPLE employeesâ€™ pay slips for A GIVEN MONTH.
